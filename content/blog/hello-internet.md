# Hello Internet

For the longest time, the internet has intrigued me. The possibilities are endless. You can meet anyone, play games, invent the next greatest thing, learn a new skill, or escape. Anything is truly possible. This same curiosity draws me into building software. When I was learning how to code I had this dream that one day I could wield a wizard's magic and cast incantations on a computer to do my bidding. Well, I can code now and it’s much less mystical than I thought however, it's a skill I deeply enjoy. Thinking of an idea and building until my heart's content. Along my journey as an engineer, I met another who shared the same curiosity or maybe it's an obsession. The same endless intrigue that could only be fulfilled by building more.

A few years passed, and so did a few projects. We built systems to run and monitor cloud infrastructure for cyber security training, real-time systems that processed telemetry data, accounting software, and fleet management software for the transportation industry. During this time, we learned a lot about what worked, and what failed miserably. Patterns that continuously held true, and foot guns that may take a whole system down.

## The Idea

However, one conversion that held the most true during this phase of learning and experimentation was that we wanted to do it for ourselves. We had the bug not to only learn everything about the internet but we had the itch to do it for us, and only us. Not a company that had boatloads of investors we constantly had to answer to. But for our families, to try software a different way. Be transparent about what it takes to build software. So we’ve set out to try something new.
The thesis is to build something sustainable that can stand the test of time. Not focus only on profits, but on building amazing things, beautiful things. Take the time to go the extra mile because we know in the long run it’s worth it. To run the marathon that may never end but take pride in what we do and how we do it. To contribute back to the world so one day we could maybe change it. We don’t want to follow the traditional tech route. Our main goal is to help society with the skills that we have and have fun along the way. We don’t take ourselves too serious but we know how to get it done.

## The Plan

The playbook is simple build FOSS (free open source software) that others can use. In doing so use that as an opportunity to train others, consult, and build additional products that could be paid. Our goal is to make the customer the sole focus and not an investor who wants to make a massive return on their investment. We have already started all of these endeavors with two products already out in the marketplace. First, [Home-cloud](https://home-cloud.io/) is a consumer device to replace your need for cloud subscriptions like `iCloud`, and `GCloud`. Second, [Draft](https://github.com/steady-bytes/draft) a `GoLang` framework for building real-time event-driven systems. Finally, consulting is something that we are actively doing, and open to doing more of in the future.

If you are interested in anything we are doing please reach out. We are looking forward to this endeavor and excited to see what we build.

Co-founders, Steady-Bytes.
