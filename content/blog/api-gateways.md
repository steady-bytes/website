# Title: Understanding API Gateways: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction: What is an API Gateway?

An API gateway is a critical component of modern web applications, serving as the intermediary between your backend services and external clients or third-party systems. It plays a pivotal role in managing traffic, ensuring security, and optimizing performance for APIs. Below are some additional components of similar networking tools used in service oriented architecture. First, let's get on the same page with a few common definitions that are often used when talking about `API Gateways`.

### Common Request Routing Components

**API Gateway:** A single point of entry for a collection of services. Common tasks are request routing, Authentication, Authorization, Monitoring, and rate limiting. Primarily used in service oriented architectures to expose a single entry point to backend services.

**Reverse Proxy:** Acts as an intermediary between the client and the backend services. The proxy receives the request from the client forwards to the backend service, and responds back to the client. Core responsibilities of a reverse proxy are. Increase security by hiding the identity of the backend services, handle SSL termination, load balance requests, compression, and caching.

**Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming network requests across backend servers. Ensuring high availability by directing healthy requests only to healthy servers and dynamically add or remove servers while request volumes fluctuate. Common routing algorithms used are Round Robbin, Least Connections, and IP Hash to make request routing decisions.

Now that we have a common understanding of different routing components in a client/server architecture. Let's dive a little deeper into functions of the `API Gateway`.

### Key Functions of an API Gateway

1. **Request Routing**:
   - Determines which backend service receives each request based on predefined routing policies.

2. **Load Balancing & High Availability**:
   - Distributes traffic across multiple backend services to prevent overloading any single point of failure.
   - Ensures high availability by automatically redirecting requests during outages or upgrading services when necessary.

3. **Security Management**:
   - Implements end-to-end encryption (e.g., HTTPS, TLS) to protect data in transit.
   - Manages authentication and authorization, ensuring only authorized users can access specific resources.
   - Supports security configurations like OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, or SSO.

4. **Quality of Service (QoS)**:
   - Prioritizes traffic based on request typeâ€”e.g., handling read operations before writes during peak hours.
   - Implements features like throttling and rate limiting to manage traffic efficiently.

5. **Integration & Orchestration**:
   - Acts as an entry point for third-party integrations, simplifying API access across various platforms.

6. **Monitoring & Logging**:
   - Collects performance metrics, such as request rates and error counts, to aid in troubleshooting.
   - Provides detailed logs for auditing purposes and detecting anomalies.

Now that we have an idea of the general feature set of an `API Gateway` let's review a few products that are already on the market we may be able to grab for our next product.

## [Treafik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/)
An open source reverse proxy written in `GoLang`. It's primary use case is as a `Kubernetes Ingress` controller configured with `k8s` manifests to control traffic flow and routing rules. I personally love this project. It's well documented, written in `GoLang` and really easy to use. I'm currently using this on a few projects of my own. It can be configured in many ways making it a reverse proxy that can be used as an `API Gateway`. This is a common pattern found with a lot of the newer reverse proxies on the market.

## [Nginx](https://nginx.org/)
Another open source web server (you might spot a trend... I like OSS projects) that's been around for a while. It was originally created to replace the `A` in the `LAMP` stack and over time has tailored it's offering to evolve with the changes in system design. A large downside for `Nginx` is the dynamic programmability feature is behind a paid enterprise license. This is a feature that comes out of the box free with many other web servers.

## [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) and [Envoy Gateway](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/)
Envoy is another huge player is the revers proxy space that can be dynamically configured with out restarting. It's go many different configuration options for all sorts of request routing. The only downside to envoy is the barrier to entry. It's less clear how routing works and really requires a deep dive into the documentation to. Similarly envoy now has the `gateway` project that seems to be a plugin into envoy to configure routing rules either in `k8s` manifests or stand alone configuration.

## [Kong](https://konghq.com/products/kong-gateway)
Another programmable reverse proxy that can act as an api gateway (basically the same playbook as all of the other). One difference is that it's written in Lua. Kong is open source. I can't say much about it because I've never actually used it. It seems like a project that may be worth looking into.

## [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)
Caddy is a yet another reverse proxy that is mainly focused on being an easy TLS termination point for your system. It's open source, and written in go, and has plenty of plugins that can be added to extend it's capabilities.

## [Fuse](https://github.com/steady-bytes/draft/tree/main/services/core/fuse)
Is not a reverse proxy, or an `API Gateway` so why am I brining it up? It's a `control plane` for `envoy` but it's configured to dynamically provision routing rules in `envoy` based on what registered services in the system tell `Fuse` they want to match against. Giving the `Draft` framework all of the features of an `API Gateway` while taking on he minimal system dependencies. `Fuse` is one of the many services that we are building as apart of the `Draft` framework. Our goal is to have a highly configurable `control-plane` that will give the whole `Draft` system a dynamic way to route traffic to services. We have much more to come on the `Fuse` front so sign-up to our newsletter so we can keep you updated on when new features land.

## Conclusion
An API gateway is an essential tool in modern web development, providing a robust framework for managing backend services. Selecting the right gateway involves evaluating scalability, cost, features, and support to ensure your application remains efficient, secure, and performant. As APIs continue to evolve, understanding how to choose and configure an API gateway will remain critical for developers and organizations alike. We are excited to see what the community thinks of `Fuse` and what improvements could be made.
